# One_piece_character_classifier
This is a side project in using neural network to identify characters of One Piece.
With using "torchvision.models.efficientnet_b1" model and adjusting the Sequantial (Classifier), to input 3024 train pics, 752 test pics and expect 18 kinds of output (characters).
After 20 epochss, we can achieve 90.9% of train accuracy and 83.74% of test accuracy.
